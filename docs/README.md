## Usage

3. The bot will create a thread with the translation result

## Command Reference

- `@translator en` - Translate to English 🇬🇧
- `@translator jp` - Translate to Japanese 🇯🇵
- `!introduce` - Display the bot's introduction and usage instructions

## Examples

1. User 1 sends a message: "こんにちは、元気ですか？"
2. User 2 replies to that message with: `@translator en`
3. The bot creates a thread with the translation: "Hello, how are you?"

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot doesn't respond**: Verify that the bot is running and has the correct permissions
- **Translation errors**: Check if your OpenAI API key is valid and that you haven't exceeded API rate limits
- **"I don't have permission to read messages" error**: Ensure the bot has the necessary permissions in your Discord server
- **Empty translation results**: This may happen if OpenAI's API fails to process the request; try again later

## Important Notes

- This bot uses OpenAI's API, which may incur usage charges
- Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to public repositories
- The bot has a message length limit of 4000 characters for translation
